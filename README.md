My work and area of focus is in System Programming and Embedded Systems as I really enjoy interacting with hardware from a software perspective. I also am very passionate and skilled in hardware design (RTL Design). Outside of the classroom, I am either playing tennis or exploring new hiking trails around Seattle. I also have a strong passion for cinematography and photography and love to capture memorable moments to look back on. I am currently a third-year student at the University of Washington and seeking for software and firmware internship positions to apply my studies towards real-world applications.
