Focusing on software development, primarily on the hardware/software interface. I also dabble in Hardware Verification and RTL design. Outside of the classroom, I am either playing tennis, aiming to finish my yearly book goals, or playing video games. I also have a strong passion for cinematography and photography, capturing strong messages and memorable moments through the lens. I am currently a third-year student at the University of Washington and seeking for software and firmware internship positions to elevate my skills. I can be reached at: cliffpmdev@gmail.com
